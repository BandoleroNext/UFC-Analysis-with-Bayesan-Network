# UFC Analysis using Bayesian Network

This project aims to analyze data from the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) using Bayesian network modeling.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis was obtained from public sources including official UFC records, fight statistics, and athlete profiles; as well as a database freely avaiable on Kaggle.

## Methodology

1. Data Cleaning: The initial step involved cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Feature Selection: Relevant features such as fighter attributes and winrate performances were selected for analysis.
3. Bayesian Network Modeling: A Bayesian network was constructed to model the relationships between different variables and predict fight outcomes.
4. Evaluation: The model was evaluated using various performance metrics and used to perform predictions.
5. Application: A user-friendly interface was created for easy access and interpretation of the analysis

## Results

The Bayesian network model demonstrated promising results in predicting fight outcomes and identifying key factors that influence performance in the UFC.

## Future Work

Future iterations of this project could include:
- Incorporating more advanced statistical techniques
- Expanding the dataset to include more fighters and attributes
